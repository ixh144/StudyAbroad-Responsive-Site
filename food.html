      <h3>Gelateria della Palma</h3>
        <p>Gelateria della Palma was one of my favorite ice cream places in Rome. Instead of getting dessert in the restaurants, I would pass by Gelateria della Palma. Each time I went I would get a different flavor of ice cream since it has more than 150 different.</p>

      <h3>Grazia e Graziella</h3>
      <p>Grazia e Graziella is my favorite restaurant. After class, I would pass by with some friends to eat local foods. The menu had a bit of everything including Mediterranean, European, and Romanian foods. In my opinion, the best plate is the steak with potatoes. It is located in Trastevere, which was a very short walk from my apartment.</p>

      <h3>Taverna Trilussa</h3>
      <p>Taverna Trilussa is a fancy restaurant with high quality Italian foods. During my 3 month study abroad, I only went once because of the price. I went to Taverna Trilussa to break Passover with an amazing truffle pasta. The food and service is always spot on. It has many incredible foods including burrata, bolognese pastas, and carpaccio.</p>

      <h3>Casetta di Trastevere</h3>
      <p>Casetta di Trastevere is an amazing food and wine at a great price. This restaurant has many food options including Italian, Mediterranean, European, and Romanian. When I went to this restaurant, the temperature was cold outside and the waiters provided blankets for us. My favorite plate was the pasta shown in the picture, it was very tasty and different from others I have tried.  </p>
