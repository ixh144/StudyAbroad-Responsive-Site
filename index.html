              <p>In 2017, my first semester of college I did a study abroad in Rome, Italy. I was able to visit many popular places around Rome and around Europe. This website will be about the sites to visit, places to eat, and travel within Europe for a decent price. </p>
              <p>I spend 3 months in the study abroad. Almost every weekend I was able to travel to different locations around Europe. I visited Ibiza, Prague, Budapest, London, and Florence. I explored many new Italian restaurants and different cultures. I tried new foods with cheaper prices than expected.</p>
              <p>One of my favorite things about my study abroad was that I realized that the Jewish community had many special quarters in different parts of Europe. In Prague, I did a synagogue tour where I was able to learn about the Judaism there. </p>
